# Given an array A, find the nearest smaller element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array such that the element has an index smaller than i.
#
# More formally,
#
# G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] such that
#
# j is maximum possible AND
#
# j < i AND
#
# A[j] < A[i]
#
# Elements for which no smaller element exist, consider the next smaller element as -1.
