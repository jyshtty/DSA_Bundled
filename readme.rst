Big observation - 

in bfs --- you check temp.left is present or not before appending

in recursion --- you dont check. But checking is done as part of base-case


============================================================================


Depth - number of edges from root to the nod

Height - Number of edges from node to leaf


============================================================================

For bfs -   use queue
For dfs -   use stack
