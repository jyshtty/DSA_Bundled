# Time complexity - O(N)
# Space Complexity - O(1)

# 1. take 5 variables - left, right, left_max, right_max, and res
# 2. While left <= right
# 3. check if height on the left less than height on right. This is because in prefixmax method we used to calculate water accumulated on top of a block by min(left_max, right_max) - height.
# but here instead of finding min in between prefix max left and prefix max right, whichever is les in between height[left] and height[right] is executed.
# 4. if height[left]  > leftmax, no water is accumulated over.
# so just update leftmax
# 5. Otherwise water is accumalated on height[left]. which is given by ans = left_max - height[left]
