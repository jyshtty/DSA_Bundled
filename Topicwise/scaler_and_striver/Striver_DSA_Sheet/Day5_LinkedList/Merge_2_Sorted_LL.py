# leetcode 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists
# You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
# Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
# Return the head of the merged linked list.
# https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/
# Example 1:
# Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
# Approach: Iterative merge
# Time Complexity: O(m+n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# Implementation:

    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

# class Solution:
#     def mergeTwoLists(self, l1, l2):
#         if l1 is None:
#             return l2
#         elif l2 is None:
#             return l1
#         elif l1.val < l2.val:
#             l1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2)

#         else:
#             l2.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next)
#             return l2

    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1, l2):
        # maintain an unchanging reference to node ahead of the return node.

                prev.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            prev = prev.next

        # At least one of l1 and l2 can still have nodes at this point, so connect
        # the non-null list to the end of the merged list.
